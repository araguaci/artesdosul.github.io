The best and worst thing about being a web developer is that the web is constantly changing. While this is exciting it also means that web developers must always be proactive in learning new techniques or programming languages, adapting to changes, and be willing and eager to accept new challenges. This could include tasks such as adapting existing frameworks to meet business requirements, testing a website to identify technical problems, or optimizing and scaling a site to better perform with the backend infrastructure. We thought we would compile a comprehensive list of **web development tools and resources** that can help you be more productive, stay informed, and become a better developer.

Web development tools and resources[#](#web-development-tools-and-resources)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of these web development tools below are ones we use at KeyCDN on a daily basis. We can't include everything, but here are a couple of our favorites and other widely used ones. Hopefully, you find a new tool or resource that will **aid you in your development workflow**. The tools and resources below are listed in no particular order.

JavaScript libraries[#](#javascript-libraries)


--------------------------------------------------

JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages on the web. A **JavaScript library** is a library of pre-written JavaScript which allows easier access throughout the development of your website or application. For example, you can include a copy of Google's hosted jQuery library by using the following snippet.

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

*   [jQuery](http://jquery.com): A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
*   [BackBoneJS](http://backbonejs.org): Give your JS app some backbone with models, views, collections, & events.

*   [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org): Functional programming helpers without extending any built-in objects.
*   [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com): Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in JavaScript.
*   [Lodash](https://lodash.com): A modern utility library delivering modularity, performance, & extras.
*   [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org): An open source JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces.

Frontend frameworks[#](#frontend-frameworks)


------------------------------------------------

**Frontend frameworks** usually consist of a package that is made up of other files and folders, such as HTML, CSS, JavasScript, etc. There are also many stand-alone frameworks out there. We are a big fan of Boostrap and the main KeyCDN website is built on it. A solid framework can be an essential tool for frontend developers.

*   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com): HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
*   [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com): Family of responsive frontend frameworks that make it easy to design beautiful responsive websites, apps and emails that look amazing on any device.
*   [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com): Development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.
*   [uikit](http://getuikit.com): A lightweight and modular frontend framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

To learn more about the differences between popular frontend framework, check out our list of the [top frontend frameworks](/blog/frontend-frameworks).

Web application frameworks[#](#web-application-frameworks)


--------------------------------------------------------------

A **web application framework** is a software framework designed to aid and alleviate some of the headache involved in the development of web applications and services.

Task runners / Package managers[#](#task-runners-package-managers)


----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tasks runners** are all about automating your workflow. For example, you can create a task and automate the minification of JavaScript. Then build and combine tasks to speed up development time. **Package managers** keep track of all the packages you use and make sure they are up to date and the specific version that you need.

Languages / Platforms[#](#languages-platforms)


--------------------------------------------------

Behind all the web development tools is a language. A **programming language** is a formal constructed language designed to communicate with a computer and create programs in which you can control the behavior. And yes we realize some of these might not always be referred to as a language.
